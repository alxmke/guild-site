## Design principles

### Good design

- Simple yet effective
- Easy to find important resources (Download buttons, fourms, docs, etc.)
- Condensed information (Graphics/info condensed into a single graphic/animation)
- Pages designed to fit screens
- Most important things front and center
- Interactive design elements

### Bad design

- Annoying pop-ups / clutter
- Random flashing buttons on the side of my screen
- Websites that don't fit your screen well
- Hard to find important resources
- Design inconsistency
- Buttons that don't work
